		<option name="coverage">Calculate seqence coverage for each allele. Turns off fuzzy (-z 1). Requires bwa, bamtools and samtools.</option>
		<option name="kmer">Kmer length for the stringMLST database which is used for assigning STs to input sample files.</option>
		<option name="fuzzy">Threshold for reporting a fuzzy match. For higher coverage reads this threshold should be set higher to avoid indicating fuzzy match when exact match was more likely. For lower coverage reads, threshold smaller or equal to 100 is recommended</option>

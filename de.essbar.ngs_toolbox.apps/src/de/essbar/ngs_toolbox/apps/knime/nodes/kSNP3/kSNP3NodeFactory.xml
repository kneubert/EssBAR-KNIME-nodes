    <shortDescription>
        kSNP3 estimates phylogenetic trees based upon pan-genome SNPs.

        <intro>
        kSNP3 identifies the pan-genome SNPs in a set of genome sequences, and estimates phylogenetic trees based upon those SNPs. 
        SNP discovery is based on k-mer analysis, and requires no multiple sequence alignment or the selection of a reference genome, so kSNP can take 100's of microbial genomes as input. 
        A SNP locus is defined by an oligo of length k surrounding a central SNP allele.

		<option name="kmer_length">Kmer size, which must be an odd number, defines the length of the oligonucleotides that kSNP3 identifies in all of the sequences. If kmer size is set too low, e.g. 5 bp, then there will be many such kmers that are identical by chance alone within a genome and between genomes. If kmer size is set too high, e.g. 51 bp, then because of frequent sequence variation at multiple sites within the oligo, many SNPs will be missed, since a SNP locus is defined by the conserved sequence surrounding the central base of the kmer.</option>

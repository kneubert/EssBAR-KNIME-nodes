        </intro>
        
		<option name="min_contig">Lower threshold for a contig length (in bp). Shorter contigs won't be taken into account (except for specific metrics.</option>
		<option name="threads">Maximum number of threads. The default value is 25% of all available CPUs but not less than 1. If QUAST fails to determine the number of CPUs, maximum threads number is set to 4.</option>
		<option name="labels">Human-readable assembly names. Those names will be used in reports, plots and logs.</option>
		<option name="names_parent_dir">Take assembly names from their parent directory names.</option>
		<option name="gene-finding">Enables gene finding. Affects performance, thus disabled by default. By default, we assume that the genome is prokaryotic, and apply GeneMarkS for gene finding. If the genome is eukaryotic, use --eukaryote option to enable GeneMark-ES instead.</option>
		<option name="mgm">Force use of MetaGeneMark for gene finding (instead of the default finders: GeneMarkS or GeneMark-ES).</option>
		<option name="glimmer">Use GlimmerHMM for gene finding (instead of GeneMark family of tools).</option>
		<option name="gene-thresholds">Comma-separated list of thresholds (in bp) for gene lengths to find with a finding tool.</option>
		<option name="eukaryote">Genome is eukaryotic. This options indicates that the genome is not circular.</option>
		<option name="est-ref-size">Estimated reference genome size (in bp) for computing NGx statistics. This value will be used only if a reference genome file is not specified.</option>
		<option name="gage">Starts QUAST in GAGE mode. Note: in this case, you have to specify a reference genome with -R.</option>
		<option name="contig-thresholds">Comma-separated list of contig length thresholds (in bp). Used in # contigs &ge; x and total length (&ge; x) metrics</option>
		<option name="scaffolds">The assemblies are scaffolds (rather than contigs). QUAST will add split versions of assemblies to the comparison (named assembly_name_broken).</option>
		<option name="all-alignments">Compute genome fraction, # genes, # operons metrics in the manner used in QUAST v.1.*. By default, QUAST v.2.0 and higher filters out ambiguous and redundant alignments, keeping only one alignment per contig (or one set of non-overlapping or slightly overlapping alignments). This option makes QUAST count all alignments.</option>
		<option name="min-alignment">Minimum length of alignment (in bp). Alignments shorter than this value will be filtered. Note that all alignments shorter than 65 bp will be filtered regardless of this threshold.</option>
		<option name="min-identity">Minimum IDY% considered as proper alignment. Alignments with IDY% worse than this value will be filtered.</option>
		<option name="ambiguity-usage">Way of processing equally good alignments of a contig (probably repeats): none (skip all such alignments); one (take only the very best one); all (use all alignments).</option>
		<option name="ambiguity-score">Score S for defining equally good alignments of a single contig.</option>
		<option name="strict">Break contigs at every misassembly event (including local ones) to compute NAx and NGAx statistics. By default, QUAST breaks contigs only at extensive misassemblies (not local ones).</option>
		<option name="extensive-mis-size">Lower threshold for the relocation size (gap or overlap size between left and right flanking sequence. Shorter relocations are considered as local misassemblies.</option>
		<option name="scaffold-gap-max-size">Max allowed scaffold gap length difference for detecting corresponding type of misassemblies.</option>
		<option name="unaligned-part-size">Lower threshold for detecting partially unaligned contigs.</option>
		<option name="fragmented">Reference genome is fragmented (e.g. a scaffold reference). QUAST will try to detect misassemblies caused by the fragmentation and mark them fake.</option>
		<option name="fragmented-max-indent">Mark translocation as fake if both alignments are located no further than N bases from the ends of the reference fragments. The value should be less than extensive misassembly size.</option>
		<option name="plots-format">File format for plots.</option>
		<option name="memory-efficient">Use one thread, separately per each assembly and each chromosome. This may significantly reduce memory consumption for large genomes.</option>
		<option name="space-efficient">Create only primary output items (reports, plots, quast.log, etc). All auxiliary files (.stdout, .stderr, etc) will not be created. This may significantly reduce disk space usage on large assemblies (more than 100k contigs). Note: Icarus viewers also will not be built.</option>
		<option name="silent">Do not print detailed information about each step in standard output.</option>
		<option name="no-plots">Do not draw plots.</option>
		<option name="no-icarus">Do not build Icarus viewers.</option>
		<option name="no-snps">Do not report SNPs statistics. This may significantly reduce memory consumption on large genomes and speed up computation. However, all SNP-related metrics will not be reported (e.g. # mismatches per 100 kbp).</option>
		<option name="no-gc">Do not compute GC% and do not produce GC-distribution plots.</option>
		<option name="version">Print version.</option>
